## Install üê≥
I bundled the project in 2 docker containers, however **this project was made with learning purposes and is not maintained, do not use it in a real enviorment!**

### Download the source code
Git clone the project or download the last version from [releases](https://github.com/alesbe/node-restserver/releases)

### Run the containers
Cd into the project root folder, and do `docker-compose up`, this will pull the docker images and start them.

By default, the backend server is running on port `8000`, and mongodb in port `27017`
